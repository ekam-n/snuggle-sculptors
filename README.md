# Snuggle Sculptors

Snuggle Sculptors is a simulation of a Build-A-Bear workshop where users can create their very own custom teddy bear. In this interactive experience, users go through various stages to select their bear's features, including the bear type, clothing, accessories, and a logo. 

This was a solo project, and I designed all the graphics myself.

## Features

- **Bear Selection**: Choose from a variety of bear types.
- **Top Selection**: Select a unique outfit for your bear.
- **Accessory Selection**: Add fun accessories to customize your bear.
- **Logo Selection**: Personalize your bear with a custom logo.

## Programming Patterns

This project employs various programming patterns to enhance functionality and maintainability:

- **Decorator Pattern**: Used for updating the bear as users make selections.
- **Factory Pattern**: Implemented for creating major objects within the simulation.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Utilizes principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.

## Visuals and Audio

To create an engaging user experience, I incorporated graphics and sound libraries:

- **Fractals**: Used for generating smoke effects in the background of the toy train.
- **Graphics** All created by me using Adobe Illustrator
- **Music**: 
  - [Cute Cozy Music Pack](https://1144ghost.itch.io/cutecozy-music-pack) by 1144ghost on itch.io
- **Sound Effects**:
  - [Universal UI Soundpack](https://ellr.itch.io/universal-ui-soundpack) button sounds by Ellr on itch.io
  - Crank sound by Soundsnap Originals on [Soundsnap](https://www.soundsnap.com/search/audio?query=pixabay+crank)
  - Train sound by SamsterBirdies on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/steam-engine-37399/)
